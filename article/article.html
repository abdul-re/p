          Blazers trade Damian Lillard to Bucks in blockbuster 3-team swap
        </h1>

        Damian Lillard is headed to the Milwaukee Bucks, the team announced
        Wednesday night. Lillard is part of a three-team deal also involving the
        Phoenix Suns that sees Bucks guard Jrue Holiday and Suns center Deandre
        Ayton on the move, too. Bucks receive: Damian Lillard (via Blazers)
        Trail Blazers receive: Deandre Ayton (via Suns) Toumani Camara (via
        Suns) Jrue Holiday (via Bucks) 2029 1st-round pick (via Bucks) Two
        first-round pick swaps with Bucks (2028, 2030) Suns receive: Grayson
        Allen (via Bucks) Keon Johnson (via Blazers) Nassir Little (via Blazers)
        Jusuf Nurkic (via Blazers) The trade was finalized night after NBA
        attorneys, as is always the case with trades, reviewed the terms and
        approved the deal. “The casuals won’t be addressed but the trailblazers
        fans and city of Portland that I love truly will be … and they will be
        addressed truthfully. Stay tuned,” Lillard wrote on X, the platform
        formerly known as Twitter. “Excited for my next chapter!” What this
        means: The Bucks have strengthened their pursuit of a championship,
        pairing Lillard with former two-time Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo as he
        seeks to lead Milwaukee to its second title since 2021. For the Trail
        Blazers, a new era begins behind their No. 2 overall pick Scoot
        Henderson and the former No. 1 overall pick in Ayton. For Phoenix, it
        ends its run with Ayton and moves on to Nurkic to man the middle as it
        hopes to make a title run. Allen is a valuable floor-spacer and 3-pont
        shooter while Little and Johnson will provide the Suns with added depth.
        How we got here: Lillard met with Portland multiple times this
        offseason, asking for the roster to be upgraded to the point where he
        can compete for a championship. But those efforts, evidently, have not
        gone to Lillard’s liking and led to him asking to be moved. His decision
        was revealed on the second day of NBA free agency after Portland made a
        huge splash on the first night by retaining Jerami Grant with a $160
        million, five-year deal. Lillard spent 11 seasons with the Blazers. Over
        the years, he consistently reiterated his desire to stay in Portland and
        win a title with the team that drafted him. That plan has changed. He
        wanted to go to the Miami Heat and made that clear. Portland decided not
        to accommodate that request, and instead, it’s the Bucks who now have an
        incredibly strong 1-2 punch of Lillard and Antetokounmpo heading into
        the new season. Chris Haynes reports on the history between Damian
        Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Giannis & Lillard: The acquisition of
        Lillard comes after Antetokounmpo told The New York Times over the
        summer that he wanted to see how committed the Bucks are toward winning
        another championship before deciding whether to sign a long-term deal to
        stay in Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo’s contract runs through the 2024-25
        season, with a player option for 2025-26. Lillard is owed a ransom over
        the next four years. He will make almost $46 million this coming season
        and could make as much as $216 million over the next four years if he
        exercises his option for the 2026-27 season. “Damian Lillard is an elite
        player in our league and someone we’ve long been fans of,” Bucks general
        manager Jon Horst said. “These opportunities are rare and hard to
        measure and execute. “His character, competitiveness, talent and
        experience complement our group and gives us the best chance to win at
        the very highest level as we create new memories together.” Lillard was
        asked on Twitter in May 2022 to pick one current player he’d want to
        help him reach the playoffs. He gave a one-word answer: “Giannis.” It
        will be a large, and possibly very worthwhile, investment because
        acquiring Lillard figures to make the Bucks even more of a title
        contender. Lillard’s resume: Lillard is coming off a season in which he
        averaged 32.2 points per game for the Trail Blazers. He is a seven-time
        All-NBA selection and was selected to the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team.
        He has averaged at least 24 points per game in each of the last eight
        seasons, and his career average of 25.2 points ranks fourth among active
        players (with at least 375 games) behind Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid and
        LeBron James. Last season, Lillard became the all-time leading scorer in
        Blazers history, passing Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler for the mark in a
        Dec. 19 game in Oklahoma City. Lillard had a 71-point game this past
        season against Houston, becoming the seventh player in NBA history to
        score more than 70 points in a game. The other names on that list are
        Wilt Chamberlain (who did it five times), Kobe Bryant, David Thompson,
        David Robinson, Elgin Baylor and Donovan Mitchell. He has 17 games of at
        least 50 points in his career — two of them in the playoffs — and is a
        past winner of the J. Walker Kennedy Citizenship Award and the
        Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award. He’s even an Olympic gold
        medalist. The only glaring omission on Lillard’s resume is a
        championship. And now he’ll seek a move to change that. “I want to
        express my gratitude to Damian for 11 storied years with this franchise
        and for his loyalty to the Portland community,” Cronin said. ”From
        becoming the all-time leading points scorer in franchise history to his
        dedicated commitment to youth across Oregon and the entire Pacific
        Northwest, Damian is and will remain a titan and a true trailblazer to
        this city.” His words: “I would say I want to be remembered for who I
        was, not as a player, but the principle that I stood on regardless of
        how successful I was, how major the failure was, the criticism, what
        people thought I should have did, what people think of me … no matter
        what was happening, I want to be remembered for who I was,” Lillard said
        in an interview with former teammate Evan Turner for the “Point Forward”
        podcast earlier this year. Information from The Associated Press
        contributed to this report.

        <h1>Damian Lillard posts heartfelt goodbye to Rip City</h1>

        Dear Rip City, I want to start off by saying this isn’t a goodbye, it’s
        a see you later. My words have always been from the heart when it comes
        to you Rip City. I consider you my home as well as many of my family
        members and that won’t change. I’ve built my entire adulthood here and
        made so many friends that I will never forget. The moments on the
        basketball court as great as they have been, don’t even compare to the
        experience I’ve had with all of you. The way you embraced me from day
        one gave me no choice but to reciprocate the love a thousand times and I
        don’t regret it one bit. I must admit that it does make me sad to see
        some people crossover and appear as my opposition in the wake of me
        asking to be traded without knowing the facts because I am truly one of
        you. I hope there is a day where we can come together and reminisce on
        the great times as we won’t have them again — at least not as they were.
        I was the young, new, confident, chip on my shoulder, prideful,
        competitive, Rip City loving, mid-major PG that you al couldn’t get
        enough of. Now I’m older and on my way out the door, a door that I
        always prayed would lead to retirement — not another team. I leave with
        nothing but love for the fans and this city. That will never change. I
        want to thank Jody Allen. Jody, the first time I met you, you had on a
        pair of Alexander McQueen sneakers and a vintage Blazers jacket, and I
        thought to myself, this is a cool woman. I knew we would be alright. I
        apologize for any misunderstanding this summer because you have truly
        been great about everything the last five years. I will be forever
        grateful for your support in some difficult situations away from
        basketball where you showed true love and compassion for my family and
        me. We will have our moment. Much love to you! Thank you to Neil Olshey
        for making me the sixth pick of the 2012 NBA Draft and allowing me the
        opportunity to land in such a great place for my life and career. I’d
        also like to thank Terry Stotts for the freedom and love he showed me
        during nine years with the organization. Without you, I wouldn’t have
        become my full self as a player. Thanks to David Vanterpool, Kaleb
        Canales, Jay Triano, Dale Osbourne, Nate Tibbetts, Jim Moran, John
        McCullough, and Kim Hughes for being the village that pushed me into the
        direction I needed right away as an NBA player. All my teammates of the
        past, you guys know who I am truly. Publicly and privately it’s the same
        and I take solace in that fact. I love you guys. To my young fella
        Anferno! LOL … He hates when I say it, but I truly believe in you man. I
        saw it from the jump. It’s not so much the gifts you have from GOD and
        pure talent but the person you are that gave me true confidence in what
        you could become in this league. I’m excited to see you become it. You
        know where you stand with me in our brotherhood and in my heart. I love
        you bra. To Chauncey, man I love you. I view David Vanterpool as my
        closest OG in the NBA along with a few others and I place you there with
        or without basketball. The last two years have been tough on you as they
        have been on me, but it has been a complete job growing my relationship
        with you bra. Coach Steve Hetzel, I appreciate you as a man and for
        challenging me to grow my game. You forever have a friend in me. Mark
        Tyndale, I appreciate you bro you know what it is. Roy, I appreciate how
        invested you are in doing what needs to be done and I appreciate you as
        a leader of men. Scotty Brooks, I’ll miss you. It’s been a true pleasure
        getting to know you. Jason and Ike, thank you for always being available
        last minute, at my house, anytime of the day … means a lot. I’ll miss
        you guys bro. Heavyn, Dr. Green — y’all my dogs and y’all better stay in
        that word without me! GOD don’t like ugly, LOL. To my guys Eric Hallman
        and Cory Lay, if I had to do your jobs, I would have quit a long time
        ago. I this league and many other occupations there are people that do
        the dirty work and behind the scenes stuff that never gets credit or
        even acknowledgment, but the ship would sink without you. Much love to
        you good brothers. Geoff Clark, bro you are one hell of a dude. I can’t
        even put into words the comfort you have given me just seeing you in the
        building every day. I love you like family and I’ll miss seeing you man.
        Cheri Hanson, if I’ve learned anything in 11 years with you, it’s that
        nobody is too big or too old to say please. I love you Miss Cheri and I
        thank you for being so kind and supportive of me. Beth Hancock, I thank
        you for being a dear friend. You’ve been so helpful and supportive of me
        from a young kid until now. And you haven’t aged a minute LOL … I love
        you BH! Jim Taylor, I’ve missed you the last few seasons but you’re one
        of us! I remember you telling me at my first All-Star Game when it got
        super busy and I was complaining that “success and failure are equally
        disastrous” and you were not lying. It’s a beautiful struggle. Nick
        West, thank you for everything man. You made everything flow and nobody
        knew the whole time. You’re a great guy and friend bro – I’ll be seeing
        you. My guy Zilla/Mr. Forcier, our time is up but the brotherhood
        remains. Much love. To Annie Klug, thank you for all your support with
        all my initiatives in the community, specifically my Respect Program
        that is so near and dear to my heart. It’s one thing to help with
        another person’s mission, but you have been invested in the program as
        much as I have, and I thank you. Bruce Ely, oh man – thank you for
        capturing every precious moment both on the court and off! You have a
        gift my friend. Tristan, thanks for always being ready to step in and
        roll. Your creativity is one of a kind. Grandpa Chico, you know what it
        is. I appreciate all that you have done for me and all one million
        things you handle. I’ll miss greeting you first every morning. RD,
        expect to get your normal texts from me because you’re the only guy I
        know that watches EVERY fight like me. Small cards to prize fights … you
        don’t know sh** about boxing though, LOL. To all the local media
        members, Casey Holdahl, Jason Quick, Sean Highkin, Danny Marang, Dwight
        Jaynes, Aaron Fentress, and whoever I may have missed, my bad. We’ve had
        our share of disagreements and heated back and forth interactions but
        for me, I’m a true man. I hold nothing against you. I’ve always tried to
        give you my real self and every opportunity to do your jobs to the best
        of my ability. Some of you have pissed me off on occasion but that’s
        part of this game. I know you guys have pressure and everyday stresses,
        and I wish you all well. When we’re stripped of what we all do for a
        living, all we have is our true selves, and I’m the kind of guy that
        cares for the well-being and quality of life of others. I want to clear
        anything negative with you because life is too short, and you just don’t
        know what people are going through. When sh** goes down your more
        human/compassionate side will beat you up when you don’t settle things.
        Much love to y’all … peace. As this chapter of my life ends, I look back
        and realize how special it was. Even in this moment I feel sad that we
        never accomplished what I so badly wanted to. I don’t cry much, but I
        know my love for you is real because I am for sure dropping some tears
        right now. Rip City you know my heart and where I stand because I’ve
        stood there for over a decade so to have to move off my square hurts my
        heart. As my guy Chief says, “One man don’t stop no show” and the show
        in Rip City must go on with or without me. I do believe a day will come
        where I put a Blazers uniform on again, and hopefully by then I’ll be
        forgiven for breaking your hearts along with my own.
